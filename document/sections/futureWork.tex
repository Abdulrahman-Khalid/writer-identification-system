\section{Future Work}
In an upcoming work, we could try generalizing our system on different forms of handwritten text by working on other datasets. Other features (in combination with \texttt{LBPH}) could be explored if \texttt{LBPH} was not enough to produce high accuracy on other forms of handwritten text. We used \texttt{scikit-image}'s implementations of LBP to construct our feature vector. Other implementations could be explored in the hope of finding a more efficient implementation. We parallelized feature extraction of different images on different processors to lower processing time. If images must be processed sequentially, we could try parallelizing the calculations of LBP for each line in an image, then collecting the results to construct the LBP histogram.
