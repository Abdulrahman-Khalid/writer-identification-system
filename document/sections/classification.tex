\section{Classification Module}
The classification module aims to train the features extracted from handwritten samples from the three different writers with their labels, then trying to predict the test handwritten sample's writer.

After research we chose support vector machine, SVM for short, to be our classification module as it has lots of pros we need such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It has lots of pros, such as it is useful in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
    \item It uses a subset of training points in the decision function. Hence, it is memory efficient.
    \item It is useful in high dimensional spaces.
\end{itemize}

The SVM algorithm's objective is to find a hyperplane that distinctly classifies the data points in an N-dimensional space where \texttt{N} is the number of features.

We are using a \texttt{sigmoid} kernel with penalty parameter \texttt{C=1} and \texttt{ovo} decision function.
Furthermore, after fitting the training images' features with their labels, we use the SVM to predict the writer from the test image features.
