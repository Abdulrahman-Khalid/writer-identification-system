\section{Conclusion}
Writer identification problem can be tackled with different approaches. We explored one of them, and found that the combination of techniques that we used in our system for preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification produced high accuracy on test sets drawn from the IAM dataset forms. By performing feature extraction of different images in parallel, we were able to greatly increase the processing speed, especially on mutli-core devices.
