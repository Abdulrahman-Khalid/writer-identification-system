\section{Introduction}
Writer identification is a problem that has lots of use cases in many fields, such as forensics and security. We created a text-independent writer identification system that is able to figure out the writer of a piece of handwritten text among several ones, given only a few handwritten samples of each writer. Our system does not require any former training to be able to identify who the writer is, it only needs two text-independent samples per writer. All the samples we worked on are full forms from the IAM Handwriting Database, and we assume that all inputs follow the same format.
