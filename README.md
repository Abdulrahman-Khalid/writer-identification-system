# Writer Identification System


## Generating a Test Set From The IAM Dataset
To generate a test set use the test set generator utility:

`python utils/generate_test_set.py`

The dataset is generated by creating hard links to existing form images in the original dataset.
The form images are NOT copied.

Find out the different options using:

` python utils/generate_test_set.py --help`

By default, the script assumes the dataset forms metadata file exists in the root directory 
and is named `dataset_forms_metadata.txt`.

Example:

` python utils/generate_test_set.py --forms ../iam_dataset --size 100`

## Measuring Performance

To measure the writer identifier's performance, in terms of accuracy and speed, use the performance measurement utility:

`python utils/measure_performance.py`

Find out the different options using:

` python utils/measure_performance.py --help`

By default, the script assumes the results, time per test case, and expected output files exist in the root directory, 
and are named `results.txt`, `time.txt` and `correct_writers.txt` respectively.
